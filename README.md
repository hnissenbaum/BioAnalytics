Source code accompanying my final project for ELEC 409. This repository contains the data obtained from Pomeroy et al, "Prediction of central nervous system embryonal tumour outcome based on gene expression", Nature 2002, and all code written, ideas and logic are the work of me, Hannah Nissenbaum in 2021.
